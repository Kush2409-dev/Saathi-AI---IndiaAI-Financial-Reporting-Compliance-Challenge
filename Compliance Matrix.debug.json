    "Company Name": "Vikas WPS Annual report",
    "Rule ID": "R1",
    "Compliance Status": "Non-Compliant",
    "Summary Finding": "The company has been declared a Non-Performing Asset by its lender banks and has explicitly disclosed in its notes to accounts that it has not accounted for or charged interest on NPA loans to its Profit and Loss Account, in contravention of IND AS 109 and 107 requirements. The financial check also confirms a suspiciously low finance cost ratio, further supporting non-compliance. The statutory auditor did not highlight this material non-compliance in their main report.",
    "Auditor Oversight": "Yes — auditor missed the material non-compliance of non-accounting for interest on NPA loans as required by IND AS 109/107",
    "Reasoning Path": "Step [1]: Does the Clause 9 of CARO reporting done by the auditor mention any default in repayment of loans (principal or interest)?\n  Answer: Yes\n  Reasoning: Step 1 asks if Clause 9 of CARO reporting mentions any default in repayment of loans (principal or interest). The table in Annexure A explicitly lists defaults in repayment of principal and interest to multiple banks, with periods of default specified (e.g., 'More than 360 days', 'Less than 180 days'). This is direct evidence that the auditor has reported defaults in loan repayments, satisfying the step's requirement.\n\nStep [2.1]: SKIPPED (conditional branch not taken)\n\nStep [2.2]: If yes, is the period of default mentioned 90 days or more?\n  Answer: Yes\n  Reasoning: Step 2.2 asks if the period of default mentioned is 90 days or more. The table in Annexure A to the Independent Auditor's Report lists defaults for Bank of India and Union Bank of India with periods 'More than 360 days' for both principal and interest. This is well above the 90-day threshold, confirming the existence of defaults of 90 days or more. The evidence is direct and explicit, matching the workflow requirement.\n\nStep [2.3]: If the default is 90 days or more, this proves the existence of the Company being declared a Non Performing Asset. If no, there is still a chance that the Company would not have accounted for the interest expenses, albeit the Company would not be a NPA\n  Answer: Yes\n  Reasoning: Step 2.3 requires determining if the default period is 90 days or more, which proves the existence of the Company being declared a Non Performing Asset. The prior findings and the quoted evidence from the CARO reporting table in Annexure A show defaults of more than 360 days for both principal and interest with multiple banks. This meets the threshold for NPA classification under RBI norms. The evidence is direct and explicit, confirming the company's NPA status.\n\nStep [3]: Check whether the independent auditor in his entire audit report mentioned that the Company has not accounted for interest expense on loans in Financial statements?\n  Answer: Not Found\n  Reasoning: I thoroughly searched the entire Independent Auditor's Report, including all key audit matters, opinion paragraphs, CARO Annexure, and internal controls annexure. I specifically looked for any explicit mention that the Company has not accounted for interest expense on loans in its financial statements, or any reference to non-accounting of interest on NPA loans. The report discusses defaults in loan repayments and periods of default, but does not state anywhere that the Company has not accounted for or charged interest expense on NPA loans to its Profit and Loss Account. There is no direct or indirect statement by the auditor regarding non-accounting of interest expense on NPA loans. Therefore, the answer is 'Not Found'.\n\nStep [4]: Has the Company in the notes to accounts and disclosures to Financial statements, mentioned it being declared a NPA by the Bank, other lenders?.\n  Answer: Yes\n  Reasoning: Step 4 asks whether the Company in the notes to accounts and disclosures to Financial statements has mentioned it being declared a NPA by the Bank or other lenders. In Note 33(a)(i), the Company explicitly states that its export credit facilities from Punjab National Bank, Union Bank of India, and Bank of India were classified as Non-Performing Assets (NPA) in June 2016. This is a direct and explicit statement confirming the Company's NPA status, fulfilling the requirement of this step. The evidence is clear and unambiguous, so the answer is 'Yes' with high confidence.\n\nStep [4.1]: If yes, has the Company mentioned the non accounting of interest expense incurred on such loans (whether NPA or not) in its Profit and loss account?\n  Answer: Yes\n  Reasoning: The workflow requires checking if the Company has mentioned non-accounting of interest expense incurred on NPA loans in its Profit and Loss account. The quoted disclosure explicitly states that after classification as NPA, the banks have not charged interest and 'Accordingly the Company is not making provision for interest on bank borrowings.' This is a direct statement confirming non-accounting of interest expense on NPA loans, matching the conditional branch for 'If yes' in step 4.1.\n\nStep [5]: If from any of the steps above, it is established that the Company has not accounted for interest on loans (be the reason that the loans become NPA or were about to become NPA), flag the status as Non Compliant. (As mentioned in failure trigger)\n  Answer: Yes\n  Reasoning: Step 5 requires flagging the status as Non Compliant if it is established that the Company has not accounted for interest on loans, regardless of the reason (NPA or otherwise). In Step 4.1, it was found that the Company explicitly disclosed non-accounting of interest expense on NPA loans. The quoted evidence from Note 33(a)(i) directly states that the Company has not provided for interest on these NPA facilities in its books. This matches the failure trigger condition, so the status must be flagged as Non Compliant.\n\nStep [6]: Is the % in financial check suspiciously low (less than % specified in Failure Trigger, indicatiing that the interest on borrowings/ NPA loans has not been accounted for/expensed?\n  Answer: Yes\n  Reasoning: Step 6 requires calculation of the ratio: (Finance Cost / Average Borrowings) × 100. \n\n1. Finance Cost (interest on borrowings): 416.27 lacs (FY 2020)\n2. Borrowings (from Balance Sheet):\n   - Opening (FY 2019): 15,529.26 lacs\n   - Closing (FY 2020): 13,564.91 lacs\n3. Average Borrowings = (15,529.26 + 13,564.91) / 2 = 14,547.09 lacs\n4. Ratio = (416.27 / 14,547.09) × 100 = 2.86%\n\nThis is well below the 6% threshold specified in the Failure Trigger, indicating that the interest on borrowings/NPA loans has not been fully accounted for/expensed. This aligns with prior findings that the company has not accounted for interest on NPA loans. All numbers are directly extracted from the report tables. The evidence is explicit and calculation is straightforward.",
