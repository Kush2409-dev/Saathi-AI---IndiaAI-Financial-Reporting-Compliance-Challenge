    "INDEPENDENT AUDI TOR'S REPORT": "VIKAS\n\nKey Audit Matter\n\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nTo The Members of Vikas WSP Limited\n\nReport on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nOpinion\n\nWe have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Vikas WSP Limited (\"the Company\"), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2020, and the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Cash Flow Statement and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\nResponsibility of Management for the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 (\"the Act\") with respect to the of\n\npreparation these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, (changes in equity) and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act.\n\nIn our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (\"the Act\") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (\"Ind AS\") and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2020, and its profit, total comprehensive income, its cash flows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date.\n\nThis responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate implementation and maintenance of accounting\n\npolicies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and and implementation\n\nprudent; design, and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to preparation the and presentation of the financial statement that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act (SAs). Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit\n\nof the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made there under, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the company's financial reporting process\n\nAuditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements\n\nAnnual Report 2019-20\n\nVIKAS\n\nevidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\nas a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's that\n\nreport includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.\n\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nMateriality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the standalone financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought on to bear our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\n· Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\n. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.\n\nof\n\n· Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would\n\nAnnual Report 2019-20\n\nVIKAS\n\namended, in our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the remuneration paid by the Company to its directors during the year is in accordance with the provisions of section 197 of the Act.\n\nreasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements.\n\nh) With respect to the other matters to be included in the Auditor's Report in accordance with Rule 11 of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014, as amended in our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us:\n\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n1.

Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.\n\nWe have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Vikas WSP Limited (\"the Company\") as of March 31, 2020 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.\n\nManagement's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls\n\nThe procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system over financial reporting.\n\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable regarding\n\nAuditor's Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Company based on our audit.

IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nNon- financial assets other than inventories and non-current assets held for sale are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication. If any such indication exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset required, the company estimates the asset's recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is higher of asset's or cash generating units (CGU) fair value less cost of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flow that is largely independent of those from other\n\nk. PROVISIONS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS\n\nProvisions involving substantial degree of estimation in measurement are recognized when there is a present obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable that there will be an outflow of resources. Contingent liabilities are not recognized but are disclosed in the notes. Contingent assets are neither recognized nor disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nl. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\n\nassets or group of assets.\n\nWhen the carrying amount of an assets or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the assets is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\n\nFinancial Assets\n\nInitial Measurement:\n\ng. STOCK IN TRADE / SECURITIES FOR SALE\n\nAll financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the\n\nStock in trade is valued at weighted average cost or net realisable value whichever is lower.\n\nAnnual Report 2019-20\n\nVIKAS\n\nacquisition of the financial asset. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\nelection on an instrument by instruments basis. The Classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.\n\nIf the company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends are recognized in other comprehensive income. There is no recycling of the amount from other comprehensive income to profit and loss even on sale of investment. However, the company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.\n\nSubsequent Measurement:\n\nSubsequent measurement is determined with reference to the classification of the respective financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristic of the financial assets, the company classifies financial assets as subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit and loss.\n\nEquity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the profit or loss.\n\nDe-recognition of Financial Assets\n\nFinancial Assets carried at amortised cost\n\nThe Company de-recognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.\n\nA financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding\n\nIf the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognizes its retained interest in the assets and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.\n\nFinancial Assets at fair value through other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)\n\nA financial asset is measured at FVOCI if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nIf the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.\n\nFinancial Liabilities Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings and payables as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.\n\nFinancial Assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n\nA financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are measured at FVTPL Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in profit and loss. However currently the company does not have any financial instrument in this category.\n\n• Borrowings\n\nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at fair value.\n\nEquity Investment\n\nAll equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value except unquoted equity investments which are stated at cost. Equity instruments which are held for trading are classified as at FVTPL. For other equity instruments, the company decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI or FVTPL. The company makes such\n\n· Financial Guarantee Contracts Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor\n\nAnnual Report 2019-20\n\nVIKAS\n\nfails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.\n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Company uses valuation techniques that appropriate\n\nare in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.\n\n• De-recognition of Financial Liabilities\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair\n\nFinancial Liabilities are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as other gains/(losses).\n\nvalue measurement as a whole:\n\n- Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n\n- Level 2 - Valuation Techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable\n\nOffsetting Financial Instruments\n\n- Level 3 - Valuation Techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.\n\nFinancial Assets and Financial Liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis; to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\nm. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\n\nThe Company measures financial assets and financial liability at fair value at each balance sheet date.\n\nThe Management analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be remeasured or re-assessed as per the Company's accounting policies. For this analysis, the Management verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation and other relevant documents.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\nn.

As the company does not deal in forex transaction, there is not foreign risk.\n\nCredit Risk\n\nCredit Risk represents the potential loss that the Company would incur if counter parties fail to perform pursuant to the terms of their obligations to the Company. The Company limits its credit risk by carrying out transactions. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position. There is no risk in terms of Bank Balances, since the counterparty is a reputable bank with high quality external credit ratings.\n\nwherever necessary.\n\nq. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nOBJECTIVES AND POLICIES\n\nFinancial Risk Factors\n\nThe Company's financial risk management is an integral part of how to plan and execute its business strategies. The Company's overall risk management program focuses the on unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Company.\n\nLiquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company's reputation. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of the financial assets and liabilities.\n\nMarket Risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Company's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.\n\nAnnual Report 2019-20\n\nVIKAS\n\nVIKAS WSP LIMITED Statement of changes in equity for the year ended March 31, 2020\n\n\n| I) Equity share capital | (INR in lacs) Amounts |\n| --- | --- |\n| Balance as at April 1, 2018 | 1,944.40 |\n| Changes in equity share capital during the year [refer note 9 (iii)] | 100.00 |\n| Balance as at March 31, 2019 | 2,044.40 |\n|  |  |\n| Balance as at March 31, 2020 | 2,044.40 |\n\n\n\n| Particulars | Reserves and surplus |  |  |  | Total equity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Retained earnings | Capital reserves | Securities premium reserve | General reserve |  |\n| As at April 1, 2019 | 48,819.92 | 101.72 | 36,424.22 | 25,126.75 | 1,10,472.61 |\n| Profit for the year | 1,990.03 | . |  | - | 1,990.03 |\n| Transactions with owners in their capacity as owners |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Proceeds from issue of equity shares [refer note 9 (iii)] |  | - |  |  | - |\n| Other comprehensive income |  |  |  | - | - |\n| Total comprehensive income | 50,809.95 | 101.72 | 36,424.22 | 25,126.75 | 1,12,462.64 |\n| As at March 31, 2020 | 50,809.95 | 101.72 | 36,424.22 | 25,126.75 | 1,12,462.64 |\n\n\n\n| For the year ended 31 March, Particulars | Reserves and surplus |  |  |  | Total equity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Retained earnings | Capital reserves | Securities premium reserve | General reserve |  |\n| As at April 1, 2018 | 44,242.17 | 101.72 | 35,093.22 | 25,126.75 | 1,04,563.86 |\n| Profit for the year | 4,577.75 |  |  |  | 4,577.75 |\n| Transactions with owners in their capacity as owners |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Proceeds from issue of equity shares [refer note 9 (iii)] |  |  | 1,331.00 |  | 1,331.00 |\n| Other comprehensive income |  |  |  |  | - |\n| Total comprehensive income | 48,819.92 | 101.72 | 36,424.22 | 25,126.75 | 1,10,472.61 |\n| As at March 31, 2019 | 48,819.92 | 101.72 | 36,424.22 | 25,126.75 | 1,10,472.61 |\n\n\nAnnual Report 2019-20\n\nVIKAS\n\n\n| Notes to the financial statements for the year ended |  | March 31, 2020 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | (INR in lacs) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 3(a) Property, plant and equipment |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 3(c) Intangible assets |\n|  | Particulars | Leasehold land | Freehold land | Buildings | Plant and equipment | Furniture and fixtures | Vehicles | Office equipment | Total | Computer software |\n|  | Gross Block |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Original Cost as at April 1, 2018 |  | 2,068.07 | 42,307.37 | 1,650.11 | 70,959.77 | 67.53 | 268.60 | 88.51 | 1,17,409.96 | 9.96 |\n| Additions during the year |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Sales/Adjustments |  | 1,161.00 |  |  |  |  |  |  | 1,161.00 |  |\n| Original Cost as at March 31, 2019 |  | 907.07 | 42,307.37 | 1,650.11 | 70,959.77 | 67.53 | 268.60 | 88.51 | 1,16,248.96 | 9.96 |\n|  | Accumulated Depreciation |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| As at April 1, 2018 |  |  |  | 564.49 | 45,087.04 | 32.63 | 189.04 | 83.16 | 45,956.36 | 5.57 |\n| Charge for the year |  |  |  | 49.92 | 3,372.69 | 6.69 | 22.69 | 0.82 | 3,452.81 | 1.67 |\n| Sales/Adjustments |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | - |\n|  | As at March 31, 2019 |  |  | 614.41 | 48,459.73 | 39.32 | 211.73 | 83.98 | 49,409.17 | 7.24 |\n|  | Net Block |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | As at March 31, 2019 | 907.07 | 42,307.37 | 1,035.70 | 22,500.04 | 28.21 | 56.87 | 4.53 | 66,839.79 | 2.72 |\n|  | Gross Block |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Original Cost as at April 1, 2019 |  | 907.07 | 42,307.37 | 1,650.11 | 70,959.77 | 67.53 | 268.60 | 88.51 | 1,16,248.96 | 9.96 |\n| Additions during the year |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Sales/Adjustments |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Original Cost as at April 1, 2019 |  | 907.07 | 42,307.37 | 1,650.11 | 70,959.77 | 67.53 | 268.60 | 88.51 | 1,16,248.96 | 9.96 |\n|  | Accumulated Depreciation |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| As at April 1, 2019 |  |  |  | 614.41 | 48,459.73 | 39.32 | 211.73 | 83.98 | 49,409.17 | 7.24 |\n| Charge for the year |  |  |  | 50.03 | 3,356.32 | 6.68 | 20.22 | 0.52 | 3,433.76 | 1.69 |\n| Sales/Adjustments |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | As at March 31, 2020 |  |  | 664.44 | 51,816.05 | 46.00 | 231.95 | 84.50 | 52,842.93 | 8.93 |\n|  | Net Block |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | As at June 30, 2019 | 907.07 | 42,307.37 | 985.67 | 19,143.72 | 21.54 | 36.65 | 4.01 | 63,406.03 | 1.03 |\n\n\n\n| 3(b) Capital work-in-progress | As at | As at | As at |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | March 31, 2020 | March 31, 2019 | March 31, 2018 |\n| Capital work in progress | 1,156.33 | 1,109.28 | 1,053.03 |\n|  | 1,156.33 | 1,109.28 | 1,053.03 |\n\n\nAnnual Report 2019-20",

The management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.\n\nI. Market risk\n\nForeign currency sensitivity\n\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in exchange rates. Foreign currency risk sensitivity is the impact on the Company's profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities. The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in USD with all other variables held constant.\n\n\n|  | Change in USD rate | Effect on profit before tax |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | Rs. in lacs |\n| For balance outstanding as at March 31, 2020 | +5% | 1,390.00 |\n|  | -5% | (1,390.00) |\n| For balance outstanding as at March 31, 2019 | +5% | 1,394.17 |\n|  | -5% | (1,394.17) |\n\n\nCredit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities primarily trade receivables. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.\n\nA. Trade receivables\n\nAn impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets disclosed in the financial statements. The Company does not hold collateral as security. The Company evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and operate in largely independent markets. Owing to the payment records of customers the Company does not foresee any credit risk.\n\nB. Financial instruments and cash deposits\n\nCredit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Company's treasury department in accordance with the Company's policy.\n\nAnnual Report 2019-20\n\nVIKAS\n\nNotes of the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2020\n\n\n| Particulars | Estimated gross carrying amount | Expected credit losses | Carrying amount |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Other financial assets (non current) | 266.08 |  | 266.08 |\n| Trade receivables | 60,560.79 |  | 60,560.79 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 106.18 |  | 106.18 |\n| Bank balance other than above | 77.92 |  | 77.92 |\n| Other financial assets (current) | 7,966.90 |  | 7,966.91 |\n\n\n\n| Particulars | Estimated gross carrying amount | Expected credit losses | Carrying amount |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Other financial assets (non current) | 266.08 | 1 | 266.08 |\n| Trade receivables | 52,525.12 | - | 52,525.12 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 56.99 |  | 56.99 |\n| Bank balance other than above | 77.92 |  | 77.92 |\n| Other financial assets (current) | 7,753.74 |  | 7,753.74 |\n\n\nIII. Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due. All current the financial liabilities of the Company are current in nature as disclosed in the financial statements.\n\n39. Investor Education and Protection Fund\n\nThere are no amounts, required to be transferred, to Investor Education and Protection Fund by the Company.\n\n40. Long term and Derivative Contracts\n\nThe Company is not dealing in derivatives and has no foreseeable losses on account of derivatives or other long term contracts, which requires provision under applicable laws or accounting standards on long-term contracts and derivative contracts.\n\nFor S.
