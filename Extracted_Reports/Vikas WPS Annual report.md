## INDEPENDENT AUDI TOR'S REPORT

VIKAS

Key Audit Matter

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

To The Members of Vikas WSP Limited

Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

Opinion

We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Vikas WSP Limited ("the Company"), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2020, and the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Cash Flow Statement and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

Responsibility of Management for the Standalone Financial Statements

The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") with respect to the of

preparation these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, (changes in equity) and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, ("Ind AS") and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2020, and its profit, total comprehensive income, its cash flows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date.

This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate implementation and maintenance of accounting

policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and and implementation

prudent; design, and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to preparation the and presentation of the financial statement that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act (SAs). Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit

of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made there under, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the company's financial reporting process

Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements

VIKAS

evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's that

report includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the standalone financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought on to bear our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

· Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.

of

· Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements.

ANNEXURE "B" TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

(Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under 'Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements' section of our report of even date) Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of Subsection 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act")

reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Vikas WSP Limited ("the Company") as of March 31, 2020 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system over financial reporting.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting

A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable regarding

Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Company based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable

assurance prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting

March 31, 2019, based on the criteria for internal financial control over financial reporting established by the Company considering the

essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

| Although these estimates are based upon management's best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results could differ from these estimates which are recognized in the period in which they are determined. OPERATING CYCLE FOR CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT CLASSIFICATION |  |
| The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/non-current classification. |  |
| All the assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current, wherever applicable, as per the operating cycle of the Company as per the guidance set out in Schedule III to the Act. |  |
| The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents. Based on the nature of activities of the Company and the normal time between acquisition of assets and their realization in cash or cash equivalents, the company has determined its operating cycle as 12 months for classification of its assets and liabilities as current and non-current. |  |
| PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT |  |
| Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at cost of acquisition including attributable interest and finance costs, if any, till the date of acquisition/ installation of the assets less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. |  |
| Subsequent expenditure relating to Property, Plant and Equipment is capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements, either on disposal or when retired from active use and the resultant gain or loss are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. |  |

Cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of cash flow statement comprise cash in hand, balances in current accounts with scheduled banks and bank deposits.

e. DEPRECIATION/AMORTISATION ON FIXED ASSETS

Depreciation on Fixed Assets is provided on straight-line method in accordance with life of assets specified in Part C of Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 as per details given below:

i. REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue in respect of sale of goods is recognized when risk and reward of ownership are transferred. The sale are accounted net of goods and service tax. Further goods returned or rejected are accounted in the year of return/rejection.

f. IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS

Non- financial assets other than inventories and non-current assets held for sale are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication. If any such indication exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset required, the company estimates the asset's recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is higher of asset's or cash generating units (CGU) fair value less cost of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flow that is largely independent of those from other

k. PROVISIONS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS

Provisions involving substantial degree of estimation in measurement are recognized when there is a present obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable that there will be an outflow of resources. Contingent liabilities are not recognized but are disclosed in the notes. Contingent assets are neither recognized nor disclosed in the financial statements.

l. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

assets or group of assets.

Financial Assets

Initial Measurement:

All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the

Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

election on an instrument by instruments basis. The Classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends are recognized in other comprehensive income. There is no recycling of the amount from other comprehensive income to profit and loss even on sale of investment. However, the company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.

Subsequent Measurement:

Subsequent measurement is determined with reference to the classification of the respective financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristic of the financial assets, the company classifies financial assets as subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit and loss.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the profit or loss.

De-recognition of Financial Assets

Financial Assets carried at amortised cost

The Company de-recognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding

If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognizes its retained interest in the assets and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.

Financial Assets at fair value through other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)

A financial asset is measured at FVOCI if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.

Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings and payables as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

Financial Assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are measured at FVTPL Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in profit and loss. However currently the company does not have any financial instrument in this category.

• Borrowings

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at fair value.

Equity Investment

All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value except unquoted equity investments which are stated at cost. Equity instruments which are held for trading are classified as at FVTPL. For other equity instruments, the company decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI or FVTPL. The company makes such

· Financial Guarantee Contracts Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor

fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

• De-recognition of Financial Liabilities

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair

Financial Liabilities are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as other gains/(losses).

value measurement as a whole:

- Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

- Level 2 - Valuation Techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable

Offsetting Financial Instruments

- Level 3 - Valuation Techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis; to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

m. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The Company measures financial assets and financial liability at fair value at each balance sheet date.

The Management analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be remeasured or re-assessed as per the Company's accounting policies. For this analysis, the Management verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation and other relevant documents.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. As the company does not deal in forex transaction, there is not foreign risk.

Credit Risk

Credit Risk represents the potential loss that the Company would incur if counter parties fail to perform pursuant to the terms of their obligations to the Company. The Company limits its credit risk by carrying out transactions. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position.

OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES

Financial Risk Factors

The Company's financial risk management is an integral part of how to plan and execute its business strategies. The Company's overall risk management program focuses the on unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Company.

Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company's reputation. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of the financial assets and liabilities.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Company's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.

Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities primarily trade receivables. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets disclosed in the financial statements. The Company does not hold collateral as security. The Company evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and operate in largely independent markets. Owing to the payment records of customers the Company does not foresee any credit risk.

B. Financial instruments and cash deposits

Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Company's treasury department in accordance with the Company's policy.
