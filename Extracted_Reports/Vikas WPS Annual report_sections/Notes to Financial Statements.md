Foreign currency risk sensitivity is the impact on the Company's profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities. The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in USD with all other variables held constant.


|  | Change in USD rate | Effect on profit before tax |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | Rs. in lacs |
| For balance outstanding as at March 31, 2020 | +5% | 1,390.00 |
|  | -5% | (1,390.00) |
| For balance outstanding as at March 31, 2019 | +5% | 1,394.17 |
|  | -5% | (1,394.17) |


Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities primarily trade receivables. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.

A. Trade receivables

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets disclosed in the financial statements. The Company does not hold collateral as security. The Company evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and operate in largely independent markets. Owing to the payment records of customers the Company does not foresee any credit risk.

B. Financial instruments and cash deposits

Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Company's treasury department in accordance with the Company's policy.
