| Although these estimates are based upon management's best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results could differ from these estimates which are recognized in the period in which they are determined. OPERATING CYCLE FOR CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT CLASSIFICATION |  |
| The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/non-current classification. |  |
| All the assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current, wherever applicable, as per the operating cycle of the Company as per the guidance set out in Schedule III to the Act. |  |
| The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash or cash equivalents. Based on the nature of activities of the Company and the normal time between acquisition of assets and their realization in cash or cash equivalents, the company has determined its operating cycle as 12 months for classification of its assets and liabilities as current and non-current. |  |
| PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT |  |
| Property, Plant and Equipment are stated at cost of acquisition including attributable interest and finance costs, if any, till the date of acquisition/ installation of the assets less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. |  |
| Subsequent expenditure relating to Property, Plant and Equipment is capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements, either on disposal or when retired from active use and the resultant gain or loss are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. |  |

Deferred tax is calculated at tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date and is recognized on timing differences, being the difference between the taxable income and accounting income that originate in one period and are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods. Deferred tax assets subject to the consideration of prudence, are recognized and carried forward is

f. IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS

Non- financial assets other than inventories and non-current assets held for sale are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication. If any such indication exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset required, the company estimates the asset's recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is higher of asset's or cash generating units (CGU) fair value less cost of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flow that is largely independent of those from other

k. PROVISIONS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS

Provisions involving substantial degree of estimation in measurement are recognized when there is a present obligation as a result of past events, and it is probable that there will be an outflow of resources. Contingent liabilities are not recognized but are disclosed in the notes. Contingent assets are neither recognized nor disclosed in the financial statements.

l. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

assets or group of assets.

When the carrying amount of an assets or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the assets is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

election on an instrument by instruments basis. The Classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends are recognized in other comprehensive income. There is no recycling of the amount from other comprehensive income to profit and loss even on sale of investment. However, the company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.

Subsequent Measurement:

Subsequent measurement is determined with reference to the classification of the respective financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristic of the financial assets, the company classifies financial assets as subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit and loss.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the profit or loss.

De-recognition of Financial Assets

Financial Assets carried at amortised cost

The Company de-recognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding

If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognizes its retained interest in the assets and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.

Financial Assets at fair value through other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)

A financial asset is measured at FVOCI if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.

Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings and payables as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

Financial Assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are measured at FVTPL Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in profit and loss. However currently the company does not have any financial instrument in this category.

• Borrowings

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at fair value.

Equity Investment

All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value except unquoted equity investments which are stated at cost. Equity instruments which are held for trading are classified as at FVTPL. For other equity instruments, the company decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI or FVTPL. The company makes such

fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

• De-recognition of Financial Liabilities

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair

Financial Liabilities are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.

- Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

- Level 2 - Valuation Techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable

Offsetting Financial Instruments

- Level 3 - Valuation Techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Balance Sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis; to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

m. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The Company measures financial assets and financial liability at fair value at each balance sheet date.

The Management analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be remeasured or re-assessed as per the Company's accounting policies. For this analysis, the Management verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation and other relevant documents.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

Credit Risk

Credit Risk represents the potential loss that the Company would incur if counter parties fail to perform pursuant to the terms of their obligations to the Company. The Company limits its credit risk by carrying out transactions. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position. There is no risk in terms of Bank Balances, since the counterparty is a reputable bank with high quality external credit ratings.

OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES

Financial Risk Factors

The Company's financial risk management is an integral part of how to plan and execute its business strategies. The Company's overall risk management program focuses the on unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Company.

Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company's reputation. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of the financial assets and liabilities.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Company's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
